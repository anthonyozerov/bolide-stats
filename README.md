# Bayesian analysis of bolides detected by GOES GLM

If you would like any assistance with running this code or editing it to suit your needs please contact me :)

Once you have all the data files described in the publication, if you would like to re-generate the impact distributions:
- Compile and run `fortran/POKORNY2013_Granvik.f`
- Run `impacts/impactdist.py`

For the main model and figures:
- Run `model_run.py`
- Run `analysis.py`
- Run `data_plots.py`
